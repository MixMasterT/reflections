When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

Remote repositories are both a good way to back up your local work, and a good way to share your work with others.
The only times you wouldn't want to push your content up to the hub would be if you want to keep them secret. If you want
to share the work with others easily, or if you want extra back-up, uploading to GitHub is a good idea!
