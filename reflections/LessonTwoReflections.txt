What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

When a repository is initialized, a .git file is added into the directory, and key meta information is stored in that file.
That file is the key to git handling version control on that directory.

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?

The working directory is the currently available set of files (the checked-out committ). The repository is a set of 
files from different times, and it is managed by the .git file stored in the working directory. The staging area is 
a list of files that have been chosen to included in the next commit. This helps the user choose what files should
and what files shouldn't be included in a given committ.
